# Blog Website in React JS ðŸ“–

This is a simple demo for a blog website developed with MERN stack and firebase authentication.

In this demo, you can do simple functions like leave comments and upvote any article, it also has a light/dark mode and a very minimalistic design.
More detailed features are:

- With firebase auth, you can create an user and then login into the website.
- If you're logged you can upvote articles, if you're not, then you can't.
- Only one vote per user, if you click the upvote button again, your vote is removed.
- All the data about the articles (comments, likes, etc) is stored in MongoDB.
- All the GET, POST, PUT routes are managed through Express JS.
- The back-end was made with Node JS.
- The front-end was created with the React/Vite libraries.

And that's all, the front-end is hosted on vercel and the back-end is hosted on render.

Thanks and take care~
